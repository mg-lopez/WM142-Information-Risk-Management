# WM142-Information-Risk-Management (Year 1)
There are substantial formal consequences in numerous regulated sectors for failure to deal appropriately with risk. There are substantial informal consequences in all sectors for failure to deal appropriately with risk.

Risk management is the identification assessment and prioritisation of the effects of uncertainty on organisational objectives, followed by the coordinated and economical application of resources to minimise, monitor, and control the combination of a) the probability of an unfortunate event occurring and b) the negative impact on organisational objectives were the unfortunate event to occur.

Information risk management takes generic risk management and applies it to the information that an organisation values in some way based on properties of that information - the restricted availability of sensitive information for example. It is important to note that information is not necessarily in the cyber domain (a hand written paper document for example). In the context of this module information is restricted to anything stored, processed or transmitted digitally.

This module is concerned with systematically addressing threats, vulnerabilities and the negative consequences that obtain should a threat exploit a vulnerability in any organisation's day-to-day cyber engagement. The organisation includes the home user, commerce, and any organisation using digital networks. This embraces most organisations in existence today or likely to exist in the future.

The module equips students to establish and maintain a risk management framework to provide assurance that information security and assurance strategies are aligned with business objectives and consistent with legal and regulatory obligations. A strong focus will be put on cost effectiveness and value to the objectives of the organisation.

Various approaches to information risk management are compared and contrasted. There is an emphasis on the practical nature of this process and the real-world issues that face managers
